# Starklings App

A web interactive tutorial to start learning Cairo and Starknet.

## About

Starklings App is a web interactive platform designed to help users kickstart their journey into learning Cairo.
This platform is based on [Starklings](https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1) exercises, considered essential for those taking their first steps in understanding Cairo.
