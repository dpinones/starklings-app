# Options

Type **`Option`** represents an optional value: every **`Option`** is either **`Some`** and contains a value, or *`None`**, and does not.
**`Option`** types are very common in Cairo code, as they have a number of uses:

- Initial values
- Return values for functions that are not defined over their entire input range (partial functions)
- Return value for otherwise reporting simple errors, where **`None`** is returned on error
- Optional struct fields
- Optional function arguments
