So, `arr0` is passed into the `fill_arr` function as an argument. In Cairo,
when an argument is passed to a function and it's not explicitly returned,
you can't use the original variable anymore. We call this "moving" a variable.
Variables that are moved into a function (or block scope) and aren't explicitly
returned get "dropped" at the end of that function. This is also what happens here.
There's a few ways to fix this, try them all if you want:
1. Make another, separate version of the data that's in `arr0` and pass that
   to `fill_arr` instead.
2. Make `fill_arr` *mutably* borrow a reference to its argument (which will need to be
   mutable) with the `ref` keyword , modify it directly, then not return anything. Then you can get rid
   of `arr1` entirely -- note that this will change what gets printed by the
   first `print`
3. Make `fill_arr` borrow an immutable view of its argument instead of taking ownership by using the snapshot operator `@`,
   and then copy the data within the function in order to return an owned
   `Array<felt>`. This requires an explicit clone of the array and should generally be avoided in Cairo, as the memory is write-once and cloning can be expensive.

Joe liked Jill's work very much. He really likes how useful storage can be.
